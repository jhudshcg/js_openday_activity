                <h2>Getting started</h2>
                <p>work in pairs and make sure you swap who is doing the coding from time to time.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Explore the existing code. The HTML, Javascript and the CSS. Can you guess what each part does?</li>
                    <li>Test your predictions. Try modifying a small bit of code and then testing what it does. Make the change, save the file and then reload the page in the browser. (Remember you can undo changes with Ctrl-Z)</li>
                    <li>In pairs answer the following questions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                What does line 17 in script.js do?                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What would line 95 in sprite.js do?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What file and line does the code to update the fps count start? (you'll need to explore the code)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What file and line does the code to check collisions between the sprites and the containing box start?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                How would you change the border color of the outer box containing the sprites to blue?
                            </li>                                              
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Can you get the sprite animation to start in a different direction? Discuss the changes you made.</li>

                <h2>The main challenge</h2>
                <p>Make the sprite bounce off all the sides of the box.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Planning is the way to succeed. First solve the problem in a simplified form, and you can discuss in pairs to help each other.</p> 
                        <p>You'll start by making a flow chart. Open a new tab in your browser and go to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://draw.io">https://draw.io</a> (or click this link)</p>
                        <p>Then open the spritecollission.svg file. Read it and then finish the flow chart.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You will use this flowchart to help you fix the JS code! <b>Now make sure you read the comments in the code...</b>
                            </li>
                            <li>How do you get the X, Y coordinates of the sprite bounding box?</li>
                            <li>How do you get the sprite direction?</li>
                            <li>What is the <b>condition</b> that needs to be met to change the direction of the sprite?</li>
                            <li>Study the code and fix it so the sprite bounces from all sides of the box!</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Evaluate your solution. What works well, what could be improved? Do you have all the information you need to make those improvements?</li>

                                Functions have a name (usefulthing, in the case of this example code) and can accept arguments (as many as you like) which are values or variables that are sent to the function and which can be used inside it.
                                the name of each argument is what it will be called inside the function. In the example usefulthing(x, w) sends the values of x and w to the function usefulthing. Then inside the function,
                                those called are named arg1 and arg2. Functions can also return values.
